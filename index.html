          SQL stands for Structured Query Language<br>
          SQL lets you access and manipulate databases<br>
          SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International
          Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987.<br>

          Although SQL is an ANSI/ISO standard, there are different versions of the SQL language.<br>

          However, to be compliant with the ANSI standard, they all support at least the major commands (such as SELECT,
          UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, WHERE) in a similar manner.<br>

          Note: Most of the SQL database programs also have their own proprietary extensions in addition to the SQL
          standard!<br>

          To build a web site that shows data from a database, you will need:<br>

          An RDBMS database program (i.e. MS Access, SQL Server, MySQL)<br>
          To use a server-side scripting language, like PHP or ASP<br>
          To use SQL to get the data you want<br>
          To use HTML / CSS to style the page<br>

          RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.<br>

          RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL,
          and Microsoft Access.<br>

          The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables. A table is a collection of related data entries
          and it consists of columns and rows.<br>

        </p>
        <p>
          Look at the "Customers" table: </p>

        <code>SELECT * FROM Customers;</code>
        <p>
          Every table is broken up into smaller entities called fields. The fields in the Customers table consist of
          CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode and Country. A field is a column in a table
          that is designed to maintain specific information about every record in the table.<br>

          A record, also called a row, is each individual entry that exists in a table. For example, there are 91
          records in the above Customers table. A record is a horizontal entity in a table.<br>

          A column is a vertical entity in a table that contains all information associated with a specific field in a
          table.<br>
